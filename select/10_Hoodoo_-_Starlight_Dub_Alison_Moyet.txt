Well now everyone says you've got a heart of gold
Huh! Yeah it's one of those things being brought and sold
Now it's back on the market I've been told
Hoodoo, you
Well I rue the day I ever saw your face

Even more the day I opened up my place
You can go and park your car in space
Hoodoo you. Hoodoo
Who do? Who do you Hoodoo too?

Save it for your mother
Save it for the judge
Save it for your brother who can never ever get enough
Share it with your neighbours
Share it with your friends
Hand it out if you're ever in doubt
But here is where your credit ends
Who do? Who do you Hoodoo too?

Well now look at all the candles on your wall
Set a little flame to one and all
Burn them out it's fine to fall
Hoodoo, you
And now don't I just know what you're coming for
Aint just for banging on my door
Well I aint hungry anymore
Hoodoo you. Hoodoo. Who do? Who do you Hoodoo too?

Save it for your mother
Save it for the judge
Save it for your brother who can never ever get enough
Share it with your neighbours
Share it with your friends
Hand it out if you're ever in doubt
But here is where your credit ends
Who do? Who do you Hoodoo too?
