Starlight ain't the daylight
But it will just have to do
Starlight will be the only light
When I can tell my heart to you

Oh, daylight, when I see you on the street again
We'll talk a while as if we're only friends
And starlight will be the only light
When I can hold you tight again

Oh starlight that I wish upon tonight
That all my dreams might come true
Star on high, why can't you hear my plight
And send me a love 'neath skies of blue?

Oh daylight, just another time to hide away
And dream about the way it might have been
And starlight will be the only light
When I can hold you tight again
Oh, that's when I can hold you tight again

Starlight ain't the daylight
But it will just have to do
Starlight will be the only light
When I can tell my heart to you

Oh, daylight, when I see you on the street again
We'll talk a while as if we're only friends
And starlight will be the only light
When I can hold you tight again
Oh, that's when I can hold you tight again
