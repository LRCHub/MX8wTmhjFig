In the middle of fight
When we always stand together
In the middle of fight
And the victory is near
In the middle of fight
When we always come together
In the middle of fight
And we always know you fall
Lucifer lucifer in starlight
In the middle of fight
When I see there’s no tomorrow
In the middle of fight
When my heart is open wide
In the middle of fight
In the victory tomorrow
In the middle of fight
When I see this hungry were
Lucifer lucifer in starlight
Die Falle des Teufels für die Menschheit
Vor allem für die Jungen, ist der Körper
Lucifer lucifer in starlight
Lucifer in starlight
